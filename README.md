## The HackaGeo

## Objective and major challenges

## Well-tie theory

The process of well-tieing is comprised of, mainly, the seismic signal reconstruction from well-log measurements.

The image below (taken from the book An Introduction to Geophysical Exploration, from Philip Kearey, Michael Brooks, and Ian Hill) shows:

    a geological section in the left panel
    its respective acoustic impedance profile
    and the correspondent reflection coefficient profile
    which convolved with the source wavelet should yield the measured signal in the location of the well (shown in the upper part of the right panel as the synthetic seismogram)
